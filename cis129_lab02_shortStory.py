print('I was sitting on the couch one night when I heard a curious noise.')
print('It sounded as if someone was slowly dragging a full grocery bag across the carpet.')
Print('I ignored it, lost in my show. A minute later I heard a sharp, hollow thud.')
print('I snapped my head in the direction of the bathroom.')
print('Another thud sounded, not as loud as the first but equally scary.')
print('I shot to my feet, eyes fixed on the open bathroon door.')
print('I shouted, "who's there!". A startled yelp, followed by a crash could be heard.')
print('I rushed to the door and flicked on the lights.')
print('A puffy, black and white cat glared at me from the tub.')
print('I noted that my shampoo and soap had been knocked down.')
print('I ran.')
